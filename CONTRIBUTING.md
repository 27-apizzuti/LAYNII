# Contributing

If you want to contribute to LAYNII and make it better, your help is very
welcome.

## Opening an issue

- Please post your questions, bug reports and feature requests
  [to our issues page](https://github.com/layerfMRI/LAYNII/issues).
- When reporting a bug, please specify your system and a complete copy of the
  error message that you are getting.

## Making a pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine.
- Create a new branch to work on. Branch from `devel`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target `devel`
  branch of the original Segmentator repository.

**Note:** Please write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit
message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not
what you did to the code.

## Docker

The Dockerfile is created using
[neurodocker](https://github.com/ReproNim/neurodocker).

Preferably modify the recipe in the Makefile than the Dockerfile directly.

Build the Dockerfile:

```bash
make Dockerfile
```

Building the image

```bash
make docker_build
```

Smoke test of the image:

```bash
INPUT_DIR=${PWD}/test_data

mkdir ${PWD}/output
OUTPUT_DIR=${PWD}/output

docker run -it --rm \
           -v "${OUTPUT_DIR}":/output \
           -v "${INPUT_DIR}":/input \
           --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    laynii:latest \
        LN_BOCO \
        -Nulled "/input/lo_Nulled_intemp.nii" \
        -BOLD "/input/lo_BOLD_intemp.nii" \
        -trialBOCO 40 -shift \
        -output /output/lo_BOLD

# clean up after test
rm -rf output
```
