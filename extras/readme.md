Here are some extra scripts that we use time to time, to perform quick and minor data manipulations.

They are not C++ code and we do not commit to maintain them rigorously. Therefore, we leave figuring out how to use them to you.

### For using `image_to_nifti.py`
If you have Python installed on your PC, do:
```
pip install numpy scipy nibabel opencv
```
or if you are using conda (anaconda or miniconda):
```
conda install numpy scipy nibabel opencv
```
